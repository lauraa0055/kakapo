                    <h2>What is a Kakapo?</h2>
                    <p>The kakapo is a endangered species of bird that has been here since it has been discovered in 1978. This species of bird is also known as the "owl-parrot".</p>
                    <h4>Appearence</h4>
                    <p> The Kakapo's appearance is very unique. The kakapo has a pale owl-like face, which gives it the nickname "owl-parrot". <br> The kakapo basically looks like an oversized avocado.

                    <h2>Behavior</h2>
                    <p> The Kakapo is nocturnal and solitary. The kakapo is so solitary of other animals that they occupy the same home they have for a long time. Not only are they solitary but these birds are flightless birds. They mostly stay in the ground
                        and walk. Although if they see some sort of fruit or seeds on a tree, they would indeed climb the tree, and would often leap from tree to tree and flap their wings. The kakapo get’s the “owl” part from it’s appearance but it gets
                        the “parrot” part from its behavior. This is because they have a unique personality.

                        <h3> Male vs Female</h3>
                        <p>The voices of the female and male are kind of different. The main difference is that the male has a more recognizable voice than a female because it does these noises more frequently. <br> The female only does a loud high pitch
                            skraak! Even then, male kakapo's do that sound too, so it's a 50/50 percent chance that it will be a female if you hear that sound. <br><br> On the other hand, males make not just the high pitched skraak, but they also make
                            a deep booming and wheezing call.<br> Listen to these sound with the audio to the left. </p>
